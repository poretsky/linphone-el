;; The linphone-el package follows the Debian/GNU Linux 'emacsen' policy and
;; byte-compiles its elisp files for each 'emacs flavor' (emacs19,
;; xemacs19, emacs20, xemacs20...).  The compiled code is then
;; installed in a subdirectory of the respective site-lisp directory.
;; Nevertheless, we do not have to take care of load-path list
;; because linphone-el does it itself.

                           "/site-lisp/linphone-el")))
  ;; If package-dir does not exist, the linphone-el package must have
  ;; removed but not purged, and we should skip the setup.
