;; The linphone-el package follows the Debian/GNU Linux 'emacsen' policy and
;; byte-compiles its elisp files for each 'emacs flavor' (emacs19,
;; xemacs19, emacs20, xemacs20...).  The compiled code is then
;; installed in a subdirectory of the respective site-lisp directory.
;; We have to add this to the load-path:
(let ((package-dir (concat "/usr/share/"
                           (symbol-name flavor)
                           "/site-lisp/linphone-el")))
  ;; If package-dir does not exist, the linphone-el package must have
  ;; removed but not purged, and we should skip the setup.
  (when (file-directory-p package-dir)
    (add-to-list 'load-path package-dir)
    ;; Make sure that the uncompiled files are also in the load-path, near the
    ;; end.  This is for moving point to the code when view help.
    (add-to-list 'load-path "/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/linphone-el" t)
    (setq linphone-sounds-directory "/usr/share/sounds/linphone-el/")
    (define-key global-map [menu-bar linphone] '("Linphone" . linphone))
    (autoload 'linphone "linphone" "Internet telephone" t)))
